# Qualcomm-Atheros-QCA9377-wireless-not-working-on-lenovo-with-Ubuntu
Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 wireless not working on lenovo with Ubuntu or Ubuntu would freeze on shutdown.

This is how I fixed the WiFi issue in my Laptop

## Identify your WiFi device. Open a terminal and issue

lspci  | grep Network

It should display the name of your WiFi card
If the output is similar to the one below, you are in luck, we can fix this easily

mansoor ~ $ lspci  | grep Network
03:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros Device 0042 (rev 30)

Once you have made sure that the Network device is the one above (rev can be 31), follow the below steps to install the driver for WiFi 

If you have **Ubuntu 17.10**, continue to *Download the firmware for the WiFi card* section.

##### Install git and tools to compile the driver

sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) git
Issue the following commands one by one. Anything written after “#” is a comment and you don’t have to execute it.

## Modify the config files
echo "options ath10k_core skip_otp=y" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath10k_core.conf

## Download the backport
wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2015/11/20/backports-20151120.tar.gz

## Extract it
tar zxvf backports-20151120.tar.gz

## cd to the directory, compile and install it. The commands 'make' and 'make install' will take some time to finish
cd backports-20151120
make defconfig-wifi
make
sudo make install

# Download the firmware for the WiFi card
git clone https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware.git

## Copy the firmware to appropriate locations. 
sudo cp -r ath10k-firmware/QCA9377 /lib/firmware/ath10k/

sudo cp /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377/hw1.0/WLAN.TF.1.0/firmware-5.bin_WLAN.TF.1.0-00002-QCATFSWPZ-5 /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377/hw1.0/firmware-5.bin

## Reboot your machine. 
That’s it. Your wifi should work now (until you do a kernel update).
